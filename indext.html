           <article>
               <div id="welcome"> Welcome to this website which was created by me Angelina Noelle Rijo. Abortion to me is completly against any moral and enthical law in the human rights. Though I am only 14 years old. My eduacation at a private school has opened me up to the cruelty of abortion, but also the valiant ways people are standing out againt this crime. I was originally introduced to The March for Life through my amazing Theology teacher. She enlightened me on the powerful message the march displays, and the reasons for its existance. I began to feel very passionate about this topic of abortion and the march as I bean to see the sins and the blessings. Though I have never been to a march, I do plan to show my pro-life support soon!  <br/> </div>

               In the 18th century and until about 1880, abortions were permitted under common law and widely practiced. They were illegal only after "quickening". This term discribes the state in which the mother could feel the baby moving in the womb. Before this quickening occured, no one believed that there was an existing human life within the womb, only when the mother justified its movements was the baby alive. This was about the same time that abortion became politicized in this country and the church condemned abortion. Then in 1895, it condemned "therapeutic abortion," meaning procedures to save a woman's life from this event. Eventually, abortion was criminalized by 1880, except when necessary to save a woman's life. This exception was not reinforced by the Church, but rather urged by the medical establishment. The American Medical Association pushed for state laws to restrict abortions. As a result, most did by 1880. Then, the Comstock Law, passed by Congress in 1873, banned items including abortion drugs which was yet another helpful step to banning this sin from human practice. Soon abortion clients were primarily white protastant women. But then as immigration began to maximize in the US, whites became fearful that immigrant children would overule their white children. This caused more white males to push for maternity. Even after abortion became illegal, women still resorted to illegal, dangerous, and desperate ways to get the procedure done. Sadly, in the 1950s and 1960s, the estimated number of illegal abortions ranged from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year documented worldwide. This rate is unaccptable. On January 22, 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in the case of Roe v. Wade, which recognized that the constitutional right to privacy extends to a woman’s right to make her own personal medical decisions — including the decision to have an abortion without interference from politicians. This law still exists today.  <br/>

                   One website I researched states the following, "The right to safe and legal abortion has been the law of the land for more than 40 years, and is a part of the fabric of this country". <br/>
                   So what these people are suppoting is that in the land of the free, the brave, the place where we are given the right to LIFE, LIBERTY, AND, THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, is weaved together with fabric of murder, sin, and unjust laws? Killing is against our American laws, the right to life is in our Amrican Constitution, and abortion is legal... How is this? How is the murder of an innocent baby any different from the murder of a sinful man??? Abortion is against every law, every moral, everything we fought for as Americans. It is against every law to mandkind. No nation, with the exception of hell itself, should legalize such a gruesomly unjust practice of murder. Why should an innocet baby suffer for the mistake of an adult? That is unknown to me. <br/>
                   Also did you know that a baby's heart is already beating within 4 weeks of being conceived? That's earlier than most women know that they are pregnant. That is earlier than when women decide to have an abortion (usually 8 weeks). So if you haven't caught on, this means that the baby is already alive, breathing, and heart beating when the abortion process is done. That. Is. Murder. And what happens to a baby in abortion? The doctor takes out the baby until it's spine is visible, the doctor than breaks the baby's spine, killing it instantly. Though there are other ways this procedure is done, this is one of them. What happens to the baby after it is killed? I can justify that it is nothing pleasant.  <br/>

                   On January 22, 1974 thousands of pro-lifers participated in the first March for Life to stand up for the unborn and against the sin of abortion poisoning our Constitution. This annual march around the US capital is a way for Americans who are against the murder of children to stand up against the Roe V. Wade law in front of those reinforcing it. Many schools make it a feild trip to come to the capital and show their support. The marchers are leaders to us all, they are the voice for the voiceless, the hope for those who never learned to hope, they are on the march to promote our God given gift, life. This is a movement that highlights the importance of life and how every life, no matter the length of its existence or size of its heart, is sacred and deserves the chance to see this beautiful God-given world, to live
life. The creation of life is sacred. The minute that a baby's heart beats, which is 4 weeks in the womb, that baby's life is sacred, he/she is alive.  This march was built for these children who are alive and being murdered in our country. People who pro-life and anti- abortion are the primary marchers. <br/>  <br/>

                   January 22, 1987<br/>
               there was a terrible snow storm on the day of the annual march. Though many marchers turned back, an estimated 10,000 people continued to march even through dangerously frigid conditions.One marcher says, “Our continuing to march that day was not stubbornness to defy the elements, but willingness to cope as best we could in our determined efforts to defend the unalienable and paramount right to life of our born and preborn brothers and sisters.”

               In 1990<br/>
               it was apparent that the March was growing tremendously. For the first time, buses had to park at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial stadium and pro-lifers took the Metro to the March<br/>
               <br/>   
               <br/>
               <br/>
               In 2002<br/>
               the March for Life was held just months after the September 11th terrorist attacks on America. The march went on and thousands courageously made the journey to Washington, DC despite the uncertainty and fear for the attack brought upon the American people.<br/>

               In 2009<br/>
              
               Obama had recently showed his support for abortion which resulted in the largest recored march up until that date.   <br/>

               Today and Beyond,<br/>
               
               people continue to flood into the Capital to show thier resentment of abortion and the crimes against the right to life it inhibits. Though this is a peaceful protest, people don't hold back their opinions as they carry signs and shout protests.<br/>

            “We want to give witness to babies who have lost their lives and be part of a movement founded in love for each other and the rights we are blessed to have,” says a Senior named Katrina Gallic who traveled 27 hours to the mach from the Unniversity of Mary to USA TODAY College.

            “There’s no reason to draw an arbitrary line after conception as to where it can be put down,” says Steve Miller, a junior at the University of Dayton.<br/>
            Miller also says, “People will say ‘it’s my body, my choice,’ but it’s more than just the woman’s body — it’s the body within them. This movement isn’t about taking away the rights of women; it’s supporting the rights of the unborn child.”

            “All life has value, no matter the tragic circumstances of its creation,” says Hillsdale College sophomore Kathleen Russo, who serves as the school’s March for Life coordinator.She also says, “There are always options and people who want to promote a culture of love,” Russo says. “We have to understand that all humans are in different circumstances but all need love, from babies in the womb to mothers in terrible situations.”  <br/>

            There are many arguments for both sides of anti and pro abortion. Though many fear that the loss of abortion is the loss of womens rights, they must also consider that it is not just the women's life that deserves to be happy, but the baby's life as well. Being pregnant should be nothing but a joyful event. But in our world today, support from parents, finacial security, and fear are usually the dictators of our decisions. This is very true for women who want an abortion, they feel alone and scared. But in order to prevent the murder of babies, the abortions, we need to help these women see that they are not alone. We need to help them be brave. Rape is a very real thing and often leads to abortion, but if we can comfort women, if we can help them see a baby instead of a problem, we can all be more pro-life. It's harder for a person to fall when there are people behind them. We are all capable of being the people behind these scared women. We have the power to save lives. We have the power to march for the right of life. We  have the power to make a difference. We have the power... <br/>
